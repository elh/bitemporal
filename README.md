# bitemporal âŒ›

Building intuition about bitemporal databases by building one for myself.

### TODO:
- [x] [API v1 done](https://github.com/elh/bitemporal/blob/main/db.go). [In memory impl](https://github.com/elh/bitemporal/blob/main/memory.go)
    - [x] Find
    - [x] List
    - [x] Put
    - [x] Delete
- [x] [XTDB, Robinhood example tests pass](https://github.com/elh/bitemporal/blob/main/memory_examples_test.go)
- [ ] History API?
- [ ] Document new intuition about mutations + the 2D time graph
    - [ ] Valid time management as a custom "version rule"?
    - [ ] "Domain time"?
    - [ ] Explore geographical map idea. 2D of data + transaction time => 3 dimensions?
- [ ] Separate "db" and "storage" models. first pass was blending XTDB APIs with Snodgrass style records and things are getting muddled.
- [ ] Consider Datomic accumulate and retract event style
- [ ] Consider immutable "storage" style
- [ ] Should data read and write APIs return tx time and valid time context at all. maybe that is relegated to "history" APIs only
- [ ] SQL backed impl
- [ ] Visualization
